But Ritschl's own emendation placidula, which hs had
proposed in his first edition, is too pleasing and too much
in the true style ol our poet, to be easily exchenged for
an uncouth phrcided.

“It remains to say a word on the hiatus. In general,

I may state that the sweeping corrections proposed by
O. F. W. Muller and the attempt made by Ritschl ts

obviate the hiatus by introducing a final d, after which
there would still be left a number of refractory passages,
have confirmed my former conviction as to the admissi-
hility of hiatus in the caesura and when the line is
divided among two or morespeakers (Iatrod. to Aul.
p. nx). But a new instance of hiatus should he added
to those previously collected in my Introduction to the
Aulularia: via hiatus hesma a cretio word ot tte aad os
a liae, such as we have it in v. 539 of the present play-

nam Idlguritae sunt alternae arbores.

“This kind of hiatus was first pointed out by Spengel,
and Brix adopted it in his note on Mera 473-

prandl, potavi, scdrtum accubui: dpstuli

and in a trochaic line, ib. 1160--
vaenihunt servi, supellex, aedes, fundi: dmnia

In the first place, it is erident that a correction would
spoil the style of the passage—though O. F. W. Miiller,
who is up to anything, has the audacity to propose
two conjectures, via that we should insert either inde
or ei In the second line it is just possible that Plautus
wrote fundis or flandris (even suades), as Biicheler says
in his valuable treatise on Latin Declension p. 18¹), but
it is far from being provere.

“A similar instance of hiatus occurs Oopt. 478 (Bria)—

neque ms rident. ‘ubi cenamus! inquam atque illi-ahnnont

where 1 should assume a short pause to express the

’mmmmum.mmmmmffimg
1 114„ It may be observed that the final d from an observation
Bitschl seems to have derived of Biichsler, Lat. Decl. p. 47.
