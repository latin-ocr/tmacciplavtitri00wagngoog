membra‘ oi the genuine reading3 Riteohl gives bote ego quom
oum meo orioro reputo [et recolo .. . .]. . .. 1 have added ree-
ttus at the end ot the line, suggested, ot oourse, by rectilo in
B, but reoommended also by the threelold alliteration and the
frequent use Plautus makes ot this word: see e. g. v. 50.

257 b. I follow the reading oi the mss.. Ritsohl has abl qui eget,
prete qaam rit pdror‘, as a baooh. trinu arraial, but in his note he
reeommends abi quisque eget quom preti sit perparvi. For the
shortening of the genetivul suffix in preti see Introd. to the Aul.
p. xxv, 258. apuys, amor is the reading oi Donatus on Ter. nun·
rv6,18; our mss. add te inthe seoond place: Ritsehl writes dpope
umor, uon plores, ull ego ted litor, but the mss. have no ego and
agree in giving re. By keeping the reading ot Donatus and the
mss, we obtain aline corresponding in melre to the preeedingand
a short trocheis metre will be found highly appropriate atter the
troohsio septenarius rora For the shortening in praes see
Introd. to the Aul. p. mvn sq. 259. Ihave marked this line
aa an iambio dimeter hypereat.‚ the next as an iambio dimeter
catal, and the third as a dipodiaiambioa hypercatal. A system
of iambis lines seems to me quite in its plaoe alter the tro-
ehaio system which preoedes.-The mss. read ert dales, whloh
1 have kept in preference to Bitsehl's dulceri. Gomp. the Eng-
lish rendering ‘though indeed it ie pleasunt‚’ where we naturally
lay a stress on ir, and the same would be the ease in Latin.
261. tuoe isin all probability the reading ot the palimpsest, the .
other mss. having vor. Camerarius was the first editor who wrote
taos. 262· In aooordunee with the preceding line Ihave here
gained the same metre (tripodis iamb. eat. ÷ trip. iamb. seat:
see Studemund de eantiois p. 29) by aslight ohange based on the
reading of the palimpsest fugat iprae remob sao, where sem olearly
means seriel, as was suggested by Ritsehl in his first edition.
