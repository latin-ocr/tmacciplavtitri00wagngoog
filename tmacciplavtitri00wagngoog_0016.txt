going changes. Those who are, like myself, much cn-
gaged in practical teaching, will agree 11111 11 is very
unplcasant to have discordant editions of atext-book in
one and the same class, tho second edition perhaps flatly

contradicting the statements of the first. While I have*
therefore added a considerable amount cf grammatica]
infor-motion which Ι thought calculated to increase the
usefnlness of my work as a school-book, I have not
changed the text iiself in many places, nor have Ι intro-
duccd many alterations into that part of the commen-
tary which was contained in the first edition ; though
Ι have now and then substituted another expression in
the place of the one originally adopted, whenevcr this
seemed to help the student to understand the subject
more readily.

In the critical notes Ι have mentioned the changes
adopted by A. Spengel in the text of his edition of
the Trinummus published by Calvary at Berlin. I have

false. In a class Iwould not (Ι may say by the way)
absolutely avoid critical discussion, but if master and

pupils should be sufficiently advanccd to appreciata critical
discussions, I think that the sense of a passage will bc

by considering the various readings proposed for it than
by merely explaining one reading which' 1s to some extent
taken on trust

In revising my notes, I have once more gone over the
old commentarios of Lambinus, Taubmann, and Linde·
mann, and Ι may say that Ι have been repaid by finding
in them some good observations which had previously
escaped my notice. In the first edition I had made much
use of the excellent edition of Professor Brix, who has
himself utilised the labours of the preceding commen-
tatora Brix's edition has meanwhile been re-issned in
1813. The editor has become a convert tc Ritschl’s d
