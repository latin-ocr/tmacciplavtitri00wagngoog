ἀπροσδόκητον of the enauing word. Plautus may, how·
ever, have written illia or illisce, as Milller thinks: Brix
adds bodie after aerumna which is certainly quite in the
style of Plautus But in my humbla opinion, the very
possibility of three or more metrical corrections, among
which it is impossible to choeac, destroys their proba-
bility and confirma the reading of the mss.

though me instances given by him should not be taken
on trust, as they are partly corrupt and partly belong to
different kinds of hiatus.

“But tc retum to the passage in our play, in which
we maintain that this hiatus should be ackncwledged,
Ritschl's nominative plural alternes appears tc us highly
