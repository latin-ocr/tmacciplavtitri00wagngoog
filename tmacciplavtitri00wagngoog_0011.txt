to his first volume, in whioh he felioitously impugna
Ritsohl's innovatione in the point of final d, and of suoh
other supposed asahelem, as cabi, oum and a nom. plur.
of the first deolension in aa. But all these soholars were,
ie may be supposed, more or less prejudiced against
Ritsohl's new doobine from the-very beginning, and
even the ooeasional violence of their expressions is little
oaleulated to moduoe a favourable impression upon im-
partial readers. The best refutationi of Ritsehl's new
theorias, and one which I eonfessto be quita satisfaotory to
my mind, is found in the very calm and oandid statement
given by Oorsseri in his new edition, Vol 11. p. 1005-
1009. Oorssen shows, by simple and ineontrorertible
numerioal statements, that ia the amaversatabaal lmapuope
‹rftlrotimaosPlaatasaadEaniaetlrefiaolDostlae
abbatiae of anuas aad quita diremerat, and that even as
early as the first Punio war the said d has disappeared in
many metanoea. (lorssen concludes-‘ It is certain that
a frequent introduotion oi an ablatival d into the text
oi Plautus does not represent a faitblirl image of the
pronunciation of ablativel formatione in the Plautino
period, and thet at present Latin Grammar should re-
oognise only those instanees of an ablatival d, whioh rest
, on the authority of the mss. or inscriptions?

“It should be added that the authority of the mss
does not favour the introduction of a final d in Plautus,
except in the osseos aad, ted, and perhaps aad (= se). In
the prepositions antid and pontid the original forms seem
also to have maintained their ground somewhat longer
than others, but aed (‘without’) red and prod appear only
in, oompounds.

“ Oonoerning adverhs‚ vve have in the famous Smara-
ooaaultam de Baouaalibus the adverb saeilwmad, and to
this we owe the introduction of a number of similar forms
in Ritsohl's new edition. But Gorssen justlyopposes this
measure 11. p. 469 sq„ as Ritsehl appears unable to allega
a single passage in which an adverb ending in d is either
wmanted by the mss. or necessitated by the metre-
exoept, perhaps at νζ 726 in the present play, where
passed would seem to avoid an inadmissible hiatus. ·
