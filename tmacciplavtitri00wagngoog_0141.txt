in this plaee maintained the ms. reading. 928. 'l'he reading is very
uncertain. The authority of the mss. is in favour ol Rhadamantem
ia Cecropia imula. but this makes the line too long. Ritsahl has,
therefore, writtenRhadamam, iollowing the analogyof aauaawhieh

see Priscian vr 53 p. 239 H. Charis. p. 66 K. Instead of this, Guyet
ingeniously conjectures Cercopia and omits iurata as a gloss, where·
